## v1.1 Requirements

### Transits

- [x] **TRAN-01**: User can calculate current transit positions against a natal chart profile — Phase 7
- [x] **TRAN-02**: User can see transit-to-natal aspects with configurable orbs (default: 1-3 by aspect type) — Phase 7
- [x] **TRAN-03**: User can see which natal houses transiting planets occupy — Phase 7
- [x] **TRAN-04**: User can see retrograde status for each transiting planet — Phase 7
- [x] **TRAN-05**: User can see whether each transit aspect is applying or separating — Phase 7
- [x] **TRAN-06**: User can generate a transit timeline for preset ranges (week, 30 days, 3 months, year) — Phase 8
- [x] **TRAN-07**: User can generate a transit timeline for custom start/end dates — Phase 8
- [x] **TRAN-08**: User can see transit events (exact aspect hits) within a date range — Phase 8

### Progressions

- [x] **PROG-01**: User can calculate secondary progressions for a target date or age — Phase 9
- [x] **PROG-02**: User can see progressed-to-natal aspects with 1 degree orb — Phase 9
- [x] **PROG-03**: User can see monthly progressed Moon positions and sign changes for a target year — Phase 9
- [x] **PROG-04**: User can see element/modality distribution shifts between natal and progressed charts — Phase 9

### Solar Arc

- [x] **SARC-01**: User can calculate solar arc directions for a target year — Phase 10
- [x] **SARC-02**: User can see solar arc-to-natal aspects with 0.5-1 degree orb — Phase 10
- [x] **SARC-03**: User can choose between true arc (default) and mean arc calculation methods — Phase 10

### Integration

- [x] **INTG-01**: Current transits auto-load when a chart profile is opened — Phase 11
- [x] **INTG-02**: Dedicated transit/progression interpretation guide injected into Claude's context — Phase 11
- [x] **INTG-03**: Combined JSON output includes natal + predictive data in a single load — Phase 11
- [x] **INTG-04**: Skill routing supports targeted queries (e.g., "transits for next 3 months") — Phase 11
- [x] **INTG-05**: User can save transit/progression/solar arc snapshots for future reference — Phase 12
- [x] **INTG-06**: Snapshot files stored with date-based naming in existing profile directories — Phase 12

**Coverage:** 21/21 requirements satisfied

## Tech Debt Closed

Two items from milestone audit, both resolved in Phase 13:
1. `meta.slug` field added to `chart.json` output — SKILL.md reference now valid
2. `--save` flag wired into `--timeline` mode — all 4 predictive modes support `--save`

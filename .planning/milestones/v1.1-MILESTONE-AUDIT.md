## Tech Debt Items

### 1. SKILL.md references non-existent `meta.slug` field

**Phase:** 11 (Interpretation Guide & Context Injection)
**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md` line 151
**Issue:** SKILL.md instructs "If chart.json is already loaded in context: use meta.slug" but chart.json's meta object has no `slug` key. Available keys are: `name`, `birth_date`, `birth_time`, `location`, `house_system`, `chart_type`, `generated_at`.
**Impact:** Low. Claude falls back to deriving the slug from `meta.name` via slugification or running `--list` to discover profile slugs. The primary routing path is a dead reference, but the fallback works reliably.
**Suggested fix:** Either add `slug` to chart.json output in `build_chart_json()`, or update SKILL.md to reference `meta.name` with slugification guidance.

### 2. `--save` flag not implemented for `--timeline` mode

**Phase:** 12 (Snapshot Storage)
**Location:** `backend/astrology_calc.py` — `calculate_timeline()` function (no `args.save` check)
**Issue:** SKILL.md routing table says "append `--save` to any predictive command" but the backend only implements save in `calculate_transits()`, `calculate_progressions()`, and `calculate_solar_arcs()`. When `--save` is passed to `--timeline`, it is silently ignored — no error, no save, no warning.
**Impact:** Medium. User intent to save a timeline goes silently unmet. No data loss (timeline still outputs to stdout), but the SKILL.md wording creates a false expectation. Phase 12 spec explicitly scoped save to phases 7, 9, 10 — so the backend is correct per spec, but SKILL.md overstates.
**Suggested fix:** Either add `args.save` support to `calculate_timeline()`, or narrow the SKILL.md routing row to say "append `--save` to transit/progressions/solar-arc commands" (not "any predictive command").

### Total: 2 items across 2 phases

## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns (TODO/FIXME/placeholder/stub) found across any v1.1 phase code. All functions contain substantive implementations. All error handling is complete.

## Regression Status

All pre-v1.1 modes verified working across multiple phase verifications:
- Natal chart creation: PASS
- `--list` profiles: PASS
- `--force` overwrite: PASS
- Exit codes (0/1/2): PASS

## Milestone Definition of Done

From ROADMAP.md:
> Add time-aware astrological analysis — current transits, transit timelines, secondary progressions, and solar arc directions — layered on top of the existing natal chart system.

**Assessment:** Fully achieved. All four predictive techniques (transits, timelines, progressions, solar arcs) are implemented, verified, routed through the skill layer, and documented in the interpretation guide. The two tech debt items are non-critical polish issues that do not block the milestone goal.

<objective>
Add comprehensive astrologer interpretation guide to the existing natal-chart SKILL.md, transforming Claude from a chart data loader into an expert astrological interpreter.

Purpose: This is the final phase -- the interpretation guide is the core value proposition. Without it, Claude loads raw JSON but cannot provide meaningful astrological analysis. The guide gives Claude a systematic framework for interpreting charts, answering specific questions, and synthesizing multiple chart factors into coherent narratives.

Output: Updated SKILL.md with interpretation guide section (~350-450 total lines), verified working skill.

  <name>Task 1: Add interpretation guide and update SKILL.md</name>
  <files>~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current SKILL.md (183 lines) at ~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md. Make these changes:

1. **Remove the Phase 6 deferral note** from the "Important Notes" section at the bottom:
   Delete the line: `- **Do NOT include astrological interpretation** in this skill (that's Phase 6)`

2. **Update the Context Loading section** (lines ~145-176) to add a transition to interpretation:
   After the existing step 4 ("Important: The chart.json contains:"), add:
   ```
   5. **Interpretation ready:** The Astrological Interpretation Guide below provides the framework for answering questions about this chart. Use it to synthesize chart data into meaningful insights.
   ```

3. **Add the Astrological Interpretation Guide section** after the "Important Notes" section (at the end of the file). This is the main deliverable. Structure it as follows:

```markdown
## Astrological Interpretation Guide

When answering questions about a loaded natal chart, apply this systematic framework. Reference the chart.json data loaded via Read tool.

### Core Principles

1. **Synthesis Over Isolation**: Never interpret placements in isolation. Weave multiple factors together.
2. **Multiple Testimonies**: Strong themes appear in multiple places (e.g., leadership via Leo Sun + Mars conjunct MC + 10th house stellium).
3. **Contradictions Are Real**: Charts contain paradoxes. Fire Sun + Water Moon = identity tension, not error.
4. **Potentials, Not Fate**: Frame interpretations as tendencies and potentials. Emphasize free will.

### Systematic Reading Framework

#### 1. Chart Ruler Analysis
The chart ruler is the planet that rules the rising sign. It has special emphasis in the chart.

**Steps:**
- Identify rising sign from `houses[0].sign` (1st house cusp) or `angles[0].sign` (ASC)
- Find ruling planet: Ari=Mars, Tau=Venus, Gem=Mercury, Can=Moon, Leo=Sun, Vir=Mercury, Lib=Venus, Sco=Mars/Pluto, Sag=Jupiter, Cap=Saturn, Aqu=Saturn/Uranus, Pis=Jupiter/Neptune
- Locate chart ruler in `planets` array — note its sign, house, and degree
- Check `dignities` for chart ruler's strength
- Check `aspects` for chart ruler's connections
- **Interpretation**: Chart ruler shows how the person approaches life, their primary expression mode

#### 2. Sect Determination
Day vs Night chart affects planetary strength.

**From chart.json:**
- `meta.chart_type` = "Day" or "Night"
- Day chart (Sun in houses 7-12, above horizon): Solar planets stronger (Sun, Jupiter, Saturn)
- Night chart (Sun in houses 1-6, below horizon): Lunar planets stronger (Moon, Venus, Mars)

#### 3. Element and Modality Balance
**From chart.json:** `distributions.elements` and `distributions.modalities`

**Element interpretation:**
- **Dominant element** (>40%): Strong expression of that quality
  - Fire: Action, enthusiasm, leadership, initiative
  - Earth: Practicality, stability, material focus, persistence
  - Air: Communication, ideas, social connection, analysis
  - Water: Emotion, intuition, empathy, depth
- **Lacking element** (<10%): Area requiring conscious development
- Note which planets are in each element for specificity

**Modality interpretation:**
- **Dominant modality** (>40%): Primary operating mode
  - Cardinal: Initiating, starting, leading
  - Fixed: Sustaining, persisting, resisting change
  - Mutable: Adapting, flexibility, versatility
- Note which planets contribute to each modality

#### 4. Planetary Dignities
**From chart.json:** `dignities` array (traditional planets Sun through Saturn only)

**Strength hierarchy:**
1. **Domicile** (rulership): Planet in home sign — strongest, acts with authority and ease
2. **Exaltation**: Planet honored — strong, elevated expression
3. **Peregrine**: Neutral territory — moderate, adaptable, neither helped nor hindered
4. **Detriment**: Opposite rulership — challenged, must work harder to express
5. **Fall**: Opposite exaltation — weakest, must overcome limitations

**Interpretation**: Strong dignities = ease of expression. Weak dignities = growth through challenge, not absence of ability.

#### 5. Aspect Interpretation
**From chart.json:** `aspects` array with planet1, planet2, type, orb, movement

**Major aspects:**
- **Conjunction** (0 degrees): Blended energies, intensification, fusion of planetary principles
- **Opposition** (180 degrees): Tension, awareness, need for integration and balance
- **Trine** (120 degrees): Harmony, ease, natural talent (can lead to complacency if unchallenged)
- **Square** (90 degrees): Friction, challenge, motivation for growth and action
- **Sextile** (60 degrees): Opportunity, support, requires conscious action to activate

**Orb consideration:** Tighter orbs (closer to 0) are stronger. Orbs under 2 degrees are very tight and powerful.

**Movement:** "Applying" aspects (planets moving toward exact) are building in strength. "Separating" aspects are releasing.

#### 6. House Emphasis
**From chart.json:** Count planets per house from `planets[].house`

**House types:**
- **Angular houses** (1, 4, 7, 10): Public, active, initiating — planets here are prominent
- **Succedent houses** (2, 5, 8, 11): Stabilizing, resources, values
- **Cadent houses** (3, 6, 9, 12): Mental, adaptive, transitional

**Stellium**: 3+ planets in one house = major life emphasis in that area

**House meanings (brief):**
1st: Self, identity, appearance | 2nd: Resources, values, self-worth
3rd: Communication, siblings, local | 4th: Home, family, roots
5th: Creativity, romance, children | 6th: Health, service, daily work
7th: Partnership, marriage, others | 8th: Transformation, shared resources
9th: Philosophy, travel, higher learning | 10th: Career, public role, legacy
11th: Community, hopes, friends | 12th: Spirituality, hidden, unconscious

**House format note:** chart.json uses "First_House" through "Twelfth_House" format.

#### 7. Fixed Stars
**From chart.json:** `fixed_stars` array (may be empty)

When present, fixed stars add a mythological layer to the conjunct planet:
- **Regulus** (29 Leo): Leadership, courage, royal qualities, success through integrity
- **Spica** (23 Libra): Gifts, success, artistic talent, abundance
- **Algol** (26 Taurus): Intensity, transformation, shadow work, raw power
- **Aldebaran** (9 Gemini): Drive, ambition, integrity tested, honor
- **Antares** (9 Sagittarius): Courage, conflict, intensity, obsession
- **Fomalhaut** (3 Pisces): Idealism, spirituality, vision, charisma
- **Sirius** (14 Cancer): Ambition, devotion, fame, guardian energy
- **Vega** (15 Capricorn): Charisma, artistic talent, social awareness
- **Polaris** (28 Gemini): Guidance, direction, sense of purpose
- **Rigel** (16 Gemini): Teaching, knowledge, expansion, ambition
- **Betelgeuse** (28 Gemini): Success, fame, danger of excess
- **Canopus** (14 Cancer): Navigation, ancient wisdom, voyaging
- **Procyon** (25 Cancer): Quick success, activity, impulsiveness

**Only mention stars that appear in the chart's fixed_stars array.**

#### 8. Arabic Parts
**From chart.json:** `arabic_parts` with part_of_fortune and part_of_spirit

- **Part of Fortune**: Where joy and prosperity flow naturally — sign shows style, compare to house cusps for life area
- **Part of Spirit**: Where conscious will and intentional action manifest

Interpret by sign placement and relationship to planets near those degrees.

### Answering Specific Questions

**"What does my Sun/Moon/Rising mean?"**
1. State sign + house placement from chart data
2. Check dignity status from `dignities` array
3. Note major aspects involving that body from `aspects` array
4. Synthesize: How these factors modify core expression
5. Give concrete life examples

**"What does this aspect mean?"**
1. Identify the two planets and aspect type
2. Explain what each planet represents in the chart (including their house and sign)
3. Describe aspect dynamic (harmony/tension/growth)
4. Check houses involved for life area context
5. Note orb tightness and movement direction

**"What about my career / relationships / [life area]?"**
1. Identify relevant house (10th for career, 7th for relationships, etc.)
2. Find house cusp sign from `houses` array
3. Find ruling planet of that sign
4. Check for planets IN that house from `planets[].house`
5. Check aspects to house ruler
6. Synthesize house expression with concrete insights

**"What are my strengths and challenges?"**
1. Planets in domicile/exaltation = natural strengths (from `dignities`)
2. Planets in detriment/fall = growth areas (from `dignities`)
3. Trines and sextiles = talents and support (from `aspects`)
4. Squares and oppositions = character builders (from `aspects`)
5. Element/modality balance shows natural abilities and blind spots (from `distributions`)

**"Tell me about my chart overall"**
1. Start with Sun/Moon/Rising triad (core identity)
2. Identify chart ruler and its condition
3. Note sect (day/night) and its implications
4. Highlight dominant element and modality
5. Point out strongest dignities and most challenging
6. Identify tightest aspects (smallest orbs)
7. Note any stelliums or pattern concentrations
8. Mention fixed stars if present
9. Weave into coherent narrative about life themes

### Synthesis Guidelines

When providing full chart readings or answering open-ended questions:

- **Lead with the most prominent features**: Tight aspects, dignified planets, stelliums, chart ruler condition
- **Build themes from multiple testimonies**: If career emphasis appears in 3+ factors, lead with that
- **Address contradictions openly**: "Your chart shows both X and Y — this creates a productive tension between..."
- **Use chart-specific data**: Always reference the actual signs, degrees, and houses from the loaded JSON
- **Avoid cookbook interpretations**: Don't just list "Sun in X means Y" — synthesize with house, aspects, and dignity
- **Ground in life experience**: Frame interpretations in terms of recognizable life patterns

### Ethical Guidelines

**Always:**
- Frame as potentials and tendencies, not fate or certainty
- Emphasize free will and conscious choice
- Focus on growth, self-awareness, and empowerment
- Respect the person's autonomy and lived experience
- Acknowledge that astrology is one lens among many

**Never:**
- Make medical diagnoses or health predictions
- Provide legal or financial advice
- Guarantee specific outcomes or timeline predictions
- Make definitive statements about relationships, death, or trauma
- Shame or judge any chart placement — every position has gifts and challenges

**Language patterns:**
- "This suggests..." not "You are..."
- "There is potential for..." not "You will..."
- "One way to work with this energy is..." not "You must..."
- "This placement often correlates with..." not "This means..."
```

4. **Verify final line count**: The updated SKILL.md should be approximately 400-480 lines total. If it exceeds 500 lines, trim the fixed stars section to only the 6 most prominent stars (Regulus, Spica, Algol, Aldebaran, Antares, Fomalhaut) and remove the most verbose synthesis examples.

5. **Preserve all existing functionality**: Do NOT modify the Mode Determination, Create Mode, List/Load Mode, or Name Search Mode sections. Only modify Context Loading (add step 5), Important Notes (remove deferral note), and add the new interpretation guide section.

  <name>Task 2: Verify skill functionality end-to-end</name>
  <files>~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Verify the updated SKILL.md works correctly by testing the complete flow:

1. **Validate SKILL.md structure:**
   - Confirm YAML frontmatter parses correctly (name, description, allowed-tools fields present)
   - Confirm all original sections still exist (Mode Determination, Create Mode, List/Load Mode, Name Search Mode, Context Loading, Important Notes)
   - Confirm new Astrological Interpretation Guide section exists after Important Notes
   - Confirm the Phase 6 deferral note is gone

2. **Test backend still works** (skill depends on this):
   ```bash
   cd C:/NEW/backend
   ./venv/Scripts/python astrology_calc.py --list
   ```
   Should list existing profiles (albert-einstein, etc.)

3. **Test chart.json readability** (skill's Read tool loads this):
   - Read `~/.natal-charts/albert-einstein/chart.json`
   - Verify JSON is valid
   - Verify all fields referenced in interpretation guide exist in actual chart data:
     - `meta.chart_type` exists
     - `planets` array with sign, house, degree fields
     - `houses` array with number, sign, degree fields
     - `aspects` array with planet1, planet2, type, orb, movement fields
     - `dignities` array with planet, sign, status fields
     - `distributions.elements` and `distributions.modalities` exist
     - `fixed_stars` array exists
     - `arabic_parts` with part_of_fortune and part_of_spirit exists
     - `angles` array with ASC entry exists

4. **Verify interpretation guide references match actual JSON paths:**
   Cross-check every field path mentioned in the guide against the actual chart.json structure. Report any mismatches as errors to fix.

5. **Count final SKILL.md stats:**
   - Total line count
   - Number of ## sections
   - Number of ### subsections
   - Confirm under 500 lines
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `cd C:/NEW/backend && ./venv/Scripts/python astrology_calc.py --list` exits with code 0
2. `~/.natal-charts/albert-einstein/chart.json` is valid JSON with all required fields
3. Every chart.json field path referenced in the interpretation guide exists in actual data
4. SKILL.md line count is 400-500 lines
5. SKILL.md YAML frontmatter is valid (starts with ---, ends with ---, has name/description/allowed-tools)
  </verify>
  <done>
Updated SKILL.md is structurally valid, under 500 lines, references correct chart.json field paths verified against real data, and the Python backend remains fully functional. The skill is ready for use — invoking it will load chart data and provide Claude with the interpretation framework to answer astrological questions.

Phase 6 requirements verification:

- **INTG-01** (Load chart JSON directly into Claude's active conversation context): Already implemented in Phase 5 via Read tool in Context Loading section. Verified preserved in Task 2.
- **INTG-02** (Inject astrologer interpretation guide prompt alongside raw JSON when loading): Implemented in Task 1 by adding the Astrological Interpretation Guide section to SKILL.md. Since SKILL.md body is injected into conversation when skill is invoked, the guide is automatically available alongside loaded chart data.
- **INTG-03** (Auto-load chart JSON into context immediately after new chart creation): Already implemented in Phase 5 (Create Mode step 4 uses Read tool). Verified preserved in Task 2.

Success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Chart JSON loads directly into Claude's active conversation context -- PRESERVED from Phase 5
2. Astrologer interpretation guide prompt injects alongside raw JSON -- NEW in Task 1
3. Chart JSON auto-loads into context immediately after new chart creation -- PRESERVED from Phase 5
4. Claude can answer specific questions about planetary aspects, house placements, and patterns -- ENABLED by interpretation guide in Task 1

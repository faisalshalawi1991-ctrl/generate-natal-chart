<objective>
Close the single verification gap for Phase 11 (INTG-01): add cross-references from all three mode-specific chart-loading steps to Context Loading steps 6-8, ensuring transits auto-load regardless of which mode opened the chart.

Purpose: The transit auto-load instruction exists in Context Loading steps 6-8 but Create Mode step 4, List/Load Mode step 5 (profile-selected path), and Name Search Mode step 3 (found path) each have inline loading sequences that do not reference those steps. A Claude following mode-specific steps strictly may complete the load without running the transit auto-load.

Output: Updated SKILL.md with three one-line cross-references added.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Context Loading cross-references to all mode-specific loading steps</name>
  <files>~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Read ~/.claude/skills/natal-chart/SKILL.md fully. Then add a cross-reference note to three locations:

1. **Create Mode step 4 (around line 63-66):** After the existing "On success" bullet points (Read chart.json, display summary, mention full chart data), add a new bullet:
   `- Then follow **Context Loading steps 6-8** below to auto-load current transits`

2. **List/Load Mode step 5 profile-selected path (around line 119-122):** After the existing bullets under "If profile selected" (Read chart.json, display summary, mention full chart data), add a new bullet:
   `- Then follow **Context Loading steps 6-8** below to auto-load current transits`

3. **Name Search Mode step 3 found path (around line 134-136):** After the existing "If found" bullets (Load chart.json, display summary), add a new bullet:
   `- Then follow **Context Loading steps 6-8** below to auto-load current transits`

Do NOT change any other content. The wording should be consistent across all three locations. Use bold for "Context Loading steps 6-8" to make it visually distinct.
  </action>
  <verify>
After writing, read the updated SKILL.md and confirm:
1. The phrase "Context Loading steps 6-8" appears at least 3 times in the file (the 3 new cross-references plus any existing references)
2. Create Mode step 4 section contains the cross-reference
3. List/Load Mode step 5 profile-selected section contains the cross-reference
4. Name Search Mode step 3 found section contains the cross-reference
5. Total line count is approximately 540 (537 + 3 new lines)
6. No other content was changed
  </verify>
  <done>All three mode-specific chart-loading steps explicitly direct Claude to follow Context Loading steps 6-8 for transit auto-load, closing the INTG-01 verification gap.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Grep SKILL.md for "Context Loading steps 6-8" — expect 3+ matches (one in each mode section)
- Verify Create Mode, List/Load Mode, and Name Search Mode sections each contain the cross-reference
- Verify no other sections were modified (line count delta should be exactly +3)
- Re-check INTG-01 truth: "Current transits auto-load when a chart profile is opened" — now satisfied regardless of entry mode
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The SKILL.md transit auto-load is reachable from every mode that loads a chart profile. A Claude following any mode-specific instruction sequence will be directed to Context Loading steps 6-8 and will execute the transit auto-load.
</success_criteria>
